# docker-mkdocs

This image lets you build a mkdocs folder. 

Check the file `example-dockerfile.yaml` to see an example of how it could be used in a multistage build.

## Pip requirements

If your docs require any pip install, add them to a file called `pip-requirements.txt` in the root folder where you are building.
